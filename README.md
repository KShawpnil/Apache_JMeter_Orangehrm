Apache JMeter software is used to perform performance testing, functional testing, and load testing of web applications. It is used to test load testing functional behavior and measuring performance. JMeter makes it possible by creating a huge number of concurrent users that simulate a heavy load. It supports various protocols, including HTTP, FTP, JDBC, and more. 

Environment and Initialization: JMeter itself is a Java application, and its core components, including the test plan structure, test elements, and the JMeter engine, are written in Java. Performance testing with JMeter helps assess how well OrangeHRM performs under various conditions, including different user loads and stress scenarios. During testing, OrangeHRM was hosted on a local server using XAMPP (http://localhost/OrangeHRM/). 

Here is the list of test cases covered, along with outcomes for testing this module:
